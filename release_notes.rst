- add a second word source collins_scrabble_words_2019.txt
  with around 270,000 words (10 times as many as english_words).
  english_words is still the default because the new
  one is too slow
- refactor tests into separate files
- refactor to have separate files for engine, display, simulator and words
- add blacklist to exclude some words from english_words lib
- MVP
